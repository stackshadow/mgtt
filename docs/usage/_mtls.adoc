MGTT support mTLS by default. If no CA is provided, an self signed certificate will be used.

If no CA-file and Certificate-file is present, mgtt will create both for you.

The server-certificate will be signed with the CA-Certificate.

Existing certificates will not be overwritten !



- You can check if tls is working with

[source,bash]
openssl s_client -servername <servername> -connect <server:port> 2>/dev/null | openssl x509 -text
