- `AUTH_USERNAME` The name of the new user
- `AUTH_PASSWOR` The password for the new user


- you can create a new user inside the config-file.

Just add this to you config file

```yaml

# set this to true to allow anonymouse login beside the username-password
anonym: false

# This will create a new user and bcrypt the password
new:
  - username: ANewUser
    password: cleartextpassword
    groups:
      - auth
      - debugging

# These are the user ( with bcrypted password )
users:
  john:
    password: JDJhJDEwJFhNNU5BMWhQOUVTQ0pUdktobUtKcnU5YmNCaXphRThqTS5vTDZPa2d4UXVyZ1dZNHNBVlJX
    groups:
    - auth
    - debugging

```


==== Anonymouse-Auth

- you can enable anonymouse auth over the config-file

- or just set the `AUTH_ANONYMOUS` environment-variable to an value ( the value doesn't matter, the variable just must be set )
